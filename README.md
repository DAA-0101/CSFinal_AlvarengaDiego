## Computer Science Final Project
### 🐍*Snake Game*🐍
I will implement my knowledge in Computer Science to create a simple Snake Game using Python. I like this project because in college I want to major in Computer Science, concentrating mainly in Game Development, so I think this project will be a beneficial experience for when I'm in college working on the Senior Project.

*requires tkinter and random module*
